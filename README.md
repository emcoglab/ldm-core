Scripts for:
- Cleaning and tokenising text corpora.
- Computing summary information about text corpora.
- Building semantic vector space models from text corpora.
- Querying semantic vector space models using various distance measures.

Scripts to run to reproduce the analysis are found in `scripts_â€¦` directories; critical ones are numbered in sequence. Non-numbered scripts are just for fun.

Ancillary computations in `core`.
